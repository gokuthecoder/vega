Outdated Dependencies: Ensure that you are using up-to-date dependencies. You can check outdated dependencies by running `npm outdated` or use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
Access Controls: Check if unauthorized users have access to sensitive parts of the application. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) where necessary.
Environment Variables: Store sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and tokens in environment variables, and never hard-code them in your application.
